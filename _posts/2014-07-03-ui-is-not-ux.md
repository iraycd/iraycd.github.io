Part 1, isn't written by me it's written by [Erik Flowers][previous_author].

It's something what everyone is confused about.
In simple we have seen people have designers have always seen it different.

It's annoying.

> How are Hackers annoyed some one calls **Cracker as Hacker**,
How a real doctor feels when a **Comedian is given a doctrait**.
Similarly, UX designers are extremely annoyed when you use the term
**UX Designer instead of UI Designer**.

Most of the communities(world) are filled with fools misunderstanding terminologies.
Including me. But I don't use them without knowledge.

I used the just the term designer. Nothing else most of the time.

If you simple need to annoy them you can just do that.
But, seriously you should be careful about the situations which lead to it.

> You have freedom to speech, not freedom to annoy others.

UX Designers do end to end. They do almost everything.
