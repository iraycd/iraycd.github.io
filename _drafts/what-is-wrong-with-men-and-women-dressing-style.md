# How cheap are men?
They are so cheap. But not all of them. But about 95% of them are cheap.
They are mentally cheap. In them few seem to be normal, but they are not.
Rest of them are not good. But they don't think you as a women. They think you as human being.
Even though roam naked in front of them. Because they are genuinely committed to one women.

It's not your boy friend. That's for sure. Not even me.

# WTF has our difficult Gene has to do with Women dressing?
It's not something wrong with men. I know you femenistic women will fight with me.
So, for you **Yes, Everything is wrong with this men.But, first something is with evolution.**

## Relation with the dress which women started were European dress?
## Mens domination, which can't be changed until few generations.

# Cultural influence on Dressing.
## India culture was the first to consider you as women.
I love indian or any women in saree. It has got a unique style.
It's traced back to 2800 BC existed in Indus Valley. But, it might be completely different.
If you compare dresses to that of Europe at the same time they had **bog dress**.
Both have a great influence.

But when you compare saree with any other women dress, they are not culturally rich.

I'm not a women. But I have common sense, so I can understand and I didn't wear a saree.

Problems with saree:
+ It shows your belly(Men will know you are fat, :P that is the thing which most women want to hide).
+ Hard to wear.
+ More time on think how to wear.
+ Heavyyyyyy..

One advantage. You look super hot, super hot and super decent.

> Indian culture can't digest women change in the dressing, but can digest men.

> I think any nation will get freedom when I women walks into a bar and drink right in front of all the men.

Which won't be happening because of 2 reason.
+ There are people who encourage her, and take different advantage. "This guys are the rapist".
+ This people are majority, they think **men can do anything** but not women.
These people are the like politician who commented "There is nothing wrong with rapist, that girl is wrong".

Rest are the people who don't care about you. But, if you do that tomorrow. You will be shocked by the result.


# Dress according to Temperature and Task

Humans started wearing dress only for few logical reasons

+ Temperature
+ Protection.
+ Carrying few things.

We can't move naked in ice cold or under hot sun.
At present their is no main need of that.
But, it has became a part of culture.


> That is why we wear dress.


# Mean invited womens dress. Not women.
Men invented most of those dress you wear and you are doing slut walk. Thank God. I have been waiting for that.

# BE LOGICAL
Before question about dress you need to know why dress are wore?
Humans are not born with dress. So, your are not born with stylish dress.

Why do men like women breast? Seriously the answer will be extremely funny but digest it.
Neurological explanation. It has to do with brain mechanisms that promote the powerful bond of a mother to her infant. Girls that means even you like breast not just men. But if you say no, something is wrong with your genes or you didn't like your mothers milk.

Why men are cheap? Exactly, every man in this world is cheap. Because we came from chimps. Even if he is not cheap in apperance. Even though they are your c


Nothing is wrong. You have freedom to wear anything. They have freedom to see anything.

If you wear a bra that show. We will look at that, if you are annoyed. WTF is wrong?
You wore a stylish dress I'm seeing you dress.

Yeah, I do have a problem. I don't complement you for your stylish dress.

You wear a short which is so small. WOW, good for you. You have got lot of air to your legs. If you wouldn't have worn anything that would have given your more air.

Let's be logical here.

# Dressing

Women in 1800 fought for their freedom. But now they are fight for them being more sluts.
Men started as chimps instinct?
Men are behind rapes. Genes is behind rapes?
Why do you like to show off?
