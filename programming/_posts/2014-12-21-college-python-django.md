Recently, My Python Guru(Jayant Kirtane) has called me. During the conversation we were discussing about how did I learn Django, I didn't have a straight forward answer for that. Because after I learn something, I just forget how I've learnt it.


> Having good lecturer is not common in india, I had the best.

**Jayant Kirtane** - He take's suggestions from his students on what to teach and ranks himself than ranking students, that makes him one of the best teachers.

## Where did I use django, when I was in college?

I have used Django in my college project/my personal project, It's called Rat Notes. It's completely [open source](https://github.com/iraycd/rat-notes). My external examiner appreciated me for that

> Note: Rat Notes is the first collaboration notes which enables you to write the notes and share with your friends and teachers. In simple, Rat notes is GitHub for Note making.

### How I impressed the external?
1. [Presentation](https://rawgit.com/iraycd/rat-notes-slides/master/index.html) - For what he opened his mouth wide open.
2. Way I wrote application. Structure, Comments, The Beauty of the code. Using python [styling](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/) as much as possible.




## How did I learn python and django?

+ Jayant Kirtane. Is my guru in computer science.
+ He told me the word "Python", He thought me that for few days.
+ Best resource to learn python: [Python - Learn python the hard way]( http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book)
+ Jayant gave me a hard copy of the book. Which I didn't return but shared with a junior who wanted to learn it.
+ I didn't read it. I just skimmed through the pages.
+ I knew how to code in C, C++ and PHP when I was learning Python.So, It was easy for me to learn python.
+ I worked on 2 or 3 PHP frameworks. So, wanted to see what was it like to work with similar framework in python.
+ There are many such frameworks. But Django is the best of all, because developer community was already using it and they are always ready to help.



## Other resources.
At the time I was learning there were no proper video tutorials. But, my journey actually started by attending PyCon 2012 and Seeing the intern requirements of Helpshift(Infinitely beta back then).

Internship Requirements Were:

+ Google App Engine.
+ Django.
+ One NoSQL Database.
+ Understanding of Git and GitHub.

## What experiences have taught me:
When I knew the basics of Django I dived into it, at first I was horrible in coding.

> Everything comes from experience and hardwork.

I have realised quite early that writing code by following good patterns is the only way I can write better code.

Every developer must follow [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) either when you are writing in python or any other language. This will help you a lot.


### Starting Point

+ Best tutorial to learn Django is always from the [Django Demo Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/)
+ Python has a huge developer community.
+ Use GitHub/Bitbucket there are many open source projects using Django.
