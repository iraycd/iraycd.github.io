But making how to solves a real problem. There are many business ideas which solves the real problem and many which add built to life.

When it comes to drones, my father has asked me to search the best drone available for ad films.
I have found many drones which are amazing. But they all didn't solve the real issue.

He has bought a panasonic PS2 which was like $10K at that time and 2 years later he found that most of the phones have better quality than that.

I picked a list of drones in the market.

+ SteadiDrone QU4D X - $16000
+ Phantom 2 + H3-3D - $959
+ AR Drone 2.0 - $309


See the price difference. Wow, seriously would anyone buy steadidrone except for serious movie makers.
I striked out AR Drone at first. I can't make serious movies with it. I have striked out SteadiDrone as it's heavily priced.

I found Phantom 2 + H3-3D more value for money than other. It gives like 20-25 mins of battery. They have many videos and documentation which makes me trust the product. But their is no one element. I didn't love the product.

What will you do when you have a drone? What you do it make a video, I want it to far distances, It should be super friendly for a video grapher. It would be better when they are I have something like oculus rift.

Then I found Bebop, Love at first sight.
