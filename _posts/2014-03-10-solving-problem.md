##Understand the Problem

One word answer to this is start questioning _***Why?***_

+ Why do I have the problem?
+ Why do I need to solve it?
+ Why am I losing focus?
+ Why..Why...Why?

##Analyze whether it's worth solving

"Should" is the question you need to focus on. But before anything else you need follow the below priority.

+ What should I do now? Watch Video or Movie `(4)`
+ How should I give presention? Waste time on learning reveal.js takes 20-1 hours `(2)`
+ Should Write a blog on problem solving? Yes. Ofcourse `(2)`
+ Tweet in office? <strike>Fucking yes.`(1)`</strike> Noooooo..`(4)`


##Don't just have one solution
If you have a intellectual team with huge diversity in skillset or multiple personality disorders,
you get amazing solutions.

	You can't pull your own chair while sitting on it.

To get solutions you need to have an eagle eye view/think out of the box.
Best solution is relax, relax and relax.


##Think again
I found the best solution. But wait. It doesn't work. Not now. Can you improve the solution?
The solution which you have got is really awesome. Does it solve tempory problems?
Go back to the loop and think again. Go back to understand it again.


##If it works. Start implementing.
