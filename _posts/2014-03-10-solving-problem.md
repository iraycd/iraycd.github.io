##Understand the Problem

Is it really a problem?
Can we define the problem in the first place?
Has anybody already solved the problem?
One word answer to this is to start questioning with _***Why?***_

+ Why do we have the problem in the first place?
+ Why do I need to solve it?
+ Why do we lose the focus on the project?
+ Why..Why...Why?

##Analyze whether is it worth solving

"Should" is the word to solve this question. But before anything else you need follow the below priority.

**Real life examples:**

+ What should I do now? Watch a video on youtube `(4)`
+ How should I give a presention? Waste time on learning [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) takes 20-1 hours `(2)`
+ Should Write a blog on problem solving? Yes. Ofcourse `(2)`
+ Tweet in office? <strike>Fucking yes.`(1)`</strike> Noooooo..`(4)`


##Don't just have one solution
If you have an intellectual team with huge diversity in skillset or multiple personalities disorder.
You get amazing and various solutions.

	You can't pull your own chair while sitting on it.

To get solutions you need to have an eagle eye view/think out of the box.
Best solution can be derived with a relaxed mind.


##Think again
I found the best solution. But wait it doesn't work right now. Can you improve the solution?
The solution which you have got, is it really awesome? Does it solve temporarily or prementatly?
Go back to the loop, understand it by thinking again.


##If works. Start implementing
