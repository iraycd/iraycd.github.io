##Things to Remembers

**"A million's not cool. A BILLION is cool."**

Not everyone is Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates.
Not everyone can create an iPhone.
Not everyone is VC-funded $100 million.

**It's nice to make a million dollars and be your own boss.**

That doesn't mean you


##Level #1. Pick a Unique Business.

Most of the guys who contact us @[gonnamake](http://gonnamake.com) want to next big thing.
Things are out of control when you want to build a next big thing.
Those who drive it in a correct direction succeed.

Facebook started as [Face book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_book) and ended as biggest network.
It's the product made by people. Which changed the soul for users requirements.

Google started as a search engine and have entered variety of domains.

Facebook has completely grown vertically, Google is growing both vertically and horizontally.

Try to solve a unique problem? Is it just your problem or every once problem? Why are you solving it?

Example :
Failed - Meme Creator( Amazing collection of all memes).
Failed - Video Portal( Create a video portal which is better than YouTube).
Pass -  Unique Video Portal( Video streaming only for Video Games or only for Cat Videos.)

##Level #2. Build trust

Trust Building is most Important. Many buy Apple products because they blindly trust it, it's important to maintain trust. For a big company it's more complex to build trust.

But for small company being more transparent about everything give more value and that is how you build trust.
Update things everywhere Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, HackerNews and Reddit.

Be social, blog to build trust, show your existance and get more opportunities.
That's how people love you, you can't make apple fans to stop buying new iPhone(That's how they built trust for your product).

One of the best example in recent year is DigitalOcean(Their PR service was amazing at their work).

##Level #3. Build product based on customer

You have a great Idea, which doesn't work if you won't have enough customers and if they don't pay you enough.

**Simple Logic:**
If your product is worth $100/Product you need to sale 10,000-20,000 Products(Bepending on the expenditure) for sure.
To make a million out of your product.

##Level #4. NO to fools, YES to benefactor.

They are many customers you will have who just give you suggestion to change the product.
Few give great ideas, morons give many ideas(sometimes demand you to change things).

You strictly avoid them, concentrate on the product.
Credit the benefactor(People with good Ideas).
Add them to your list, follow them, you might need them in future.

##Level #5. Customer Service.

Customers are god, they give you money to live.
Serve them in what in whatever way, to please them.
