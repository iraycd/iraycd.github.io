meta : Common mistakes which most of the people do during a presentation and speech.
---

#1. Never asks audience, "Can you hear me?"

If you apply comman sense, people who can't hear can't respond because THEY DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

#2. Know your audience.

It's always important to know the audience, so that you can reach to their level to explain them.

Indicate it if possible like.

Example:

 + “I guess all of you are aware with python and django"
 + “I believe most of you understand javascript”
 + "This talk is preticularly for the [so and so group]”.

Ask them to raise hand if the audiences are less than 70.


#3. Have some time sense.

Put a certain duration for each presentation.
That doesn't mean you should be skipping to next slide.
That doesn't mean you should be counting the time.
It mean you need to stick to the subject and reharse more than 2-3 times with time sense.

#4. Don't say anything in future tense.

If something is still in production it's worth a wait.
Sometimes the plans might postpone. 
Most ideas you have now will evolve over time.
People don't need to hear your ideas as it reveals entire surprise element(Even if it's apple).
Tell them about what you have and serve at present.

#5. Avoid Filler words.

 “Um,” aah,” “you know,” "I think," "and," "I..I..I..." and “like.”

 Avoid them:
 + Record and Reharse
 + Sit with a group and ask them to count the filler words
 + Power pause

#6. Use big fonts.
Try to not to read out the slide for audience.
It should be you talking on the topic.
The slides help them understand with visual presentation.
Don't try to fill the presentation with words.

#7. Speak Loud and Clear

Gives the audience a good impression that you are confident about what you are speaking. 

#8. Make Eye Contact

If you can't see the audience due the focus light. Just pretend you are watching them.

#9. If you have a good point, Repeat twice.

Whenever you have a good point about that topic repeat it twice. But don't repeat off topic topics(Please don't repeat the joke twice).

#10. Close by Thanking the audience.

#11. Take notes

Give grading to yourself and what went well and what to could be better when you are giving the next presentation.
