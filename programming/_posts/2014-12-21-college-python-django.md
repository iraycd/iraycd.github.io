## My Guru - Jayanth Kirtane

Recently my guru Jayant Kirtane has called me and asked me how did I learn Django(few of his students who want to learn Django), I didn't have a single answer. Because after learning you forget how I learnt it. He take suggestion from students on what to teach next, that makes him the best teacher.

## Where did I use django when I was in college?

I have used Django in my college project/my personal project, It's called Rat Notes. It's completely [open source](https://github.com/iraycd/rat-notes). My external examiner was so happy about everything.


But it's every old. It's a note collaboration tool for colleges. [Slide show](https://rawgit.com/iraycd/rat-notes-slides/master/index.html) which we have given and how we impressed the external.


## How did I learn python and django?

+ Jayanth Kirtane. Is my guru in computer science.
+ He told me the word "Python", He thought me that for few days.
+ Best resource to learn python: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/
+ Jayanth gave me a the hard copy.
+ I didn't read it. I just skimmed through.(I how code in C, C++ and PHP when I was learning Python. It was easy for me.)
+ I had worked on 2 or 3 PHP frameworks. So, wanted to see what was there in python.
+ There are many such frameworks. But Django is the best of all, because many guess already use it.
+ Started exploring Django. Best tutorial to learn Django is always. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/
+ Python has a huge developer community. That is one place I have learnt a lot.


## Other resources.
At the time I learn there was no proper video tutorials, but my journey actually started by attending PyCon 2012 and Seeing the job requirements of Helpshift(Infinitely beta) at present. Google App engine where I deployed my first django application and other secret projects(Just kidding).

## What experience thought me:
When I knew the basics of Django. Later I dived into Django, I was horrible in coding. In 3rd year engineering I realised. Most important thing which I learnt by experience and only experience is writing code with style and following good patterns.
