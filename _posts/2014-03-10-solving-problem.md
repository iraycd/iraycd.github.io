##Understand the Problem

One word answer to this is start questioning with _***Why?***_

+ Why do have the problem in the first place?
+ Why do I need to solve it?
+ Why are is losing focus?
+ Why..Why...Why?

##Analyze whether it's worth solving

"Should" is the question you need to focus on. But before anything else you need follow the below priority.

+ Should Write a blog on problem solving? Yes. Ofcourse `(2)`

##Don't just have one solution
If you have a intellectual team with huge diversity in skillset or multiple personalities disorder.
You get amazing solutions.

	You can't pull your own chair while sitting on it.

To get solutions you need to have an eagle eye view/think out of the box.
Best solution is relax, relax and relax.


##Think again
I found the best solution. But wait it doesn't work not now. Can you improve the solution?
The solution which you have got is it really awesome. Does it solve tempory problems.
Go back to the loop and think again. Go back to understand the it again.


##If works. Start implementing
